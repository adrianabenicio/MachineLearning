# Predictions for Properties Prices

The main goal of this project related to Machine Learning is to predict and analyze the price to buy or rent a property (like a house or an apartment). To do this, we'll use a machine learning library called sklearn and apply the K-neighboor. To get the dataset, we'll scrape multiple web pages of “VivaReal” with Python using BeautifulSoup and requests libraries.
